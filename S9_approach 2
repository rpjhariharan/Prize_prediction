Analysis and Selection of the Best Model
Linear Regression: Baseline model with lower scores in both train and test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  values, showing limited predictive capability compared to more complex models.

Decision Tree: Shows signs of overfitting, with an extremely high train 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.99) but a lower test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.634). The variance between CV scores is relatively high, indicating instability across different subsets.

Random Forest: Significant improvement over Decision Tree, with good test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.7688) and a high CV Mean 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.7613), but the Train 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.9616) and Train RMSE indicate a slight overfitting tendency.

Gradient Boosting: Best generalization performance among the models, with a high Test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.8211), the lowest Test MAE (95,429.11), and the highest CV Mean 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.8248) with a low standard deviation (0.0132). These results indicate good predictive power and stability.

XGBoost: Comparable to Random Forest but slightly behind Gradient Boosting in terms of generalization. While it achieves a decent Test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.7831), it has a higher Train MAE and Test MAE than Gradient Boosting.

Conclusion
Gradient Boosting is the best model for this dataset based on the following:

It achieves the highest test 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  (0.8211) and lowest Test MAE.
The Cross-Validation Mean 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  is the highest (0.8248) with a low standard deviation, showing stable performance across folds.
The metrics indicate good balance and generalization, without significant overfitting.
